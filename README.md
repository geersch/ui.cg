ui.cg
=====

AngularJS input directives

Installation
============

* Clone the repository
* npm install
* grunt build

Distributables (ui-cg-<version>.js & ui-cg-<version>.min.js) will be created by default. 

After all dependencies have been downloaded and the project has been built, you only need to add the module to your AngularJS module:

angular.module('myModule', ['ui.cg']);
